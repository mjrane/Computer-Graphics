# “SNAKES AND LADDERS ”
The project is programmed using C language scripting. In this game there will be two players .Only two users can compete with each other at a time. Used Turbo C++ compiler tool.

## 1. Overview:

Our game is a simple snake and ladder game. Users can toss the die one after another successive positions. If a player gets a 6 on die he can play once again. The coins will be moved on the board according to the number obtained on the die. The player who first reaches 100th position will win the match.

## 2. User Interface:

The interface is mostly concentrated on use of keyboard. Clicking the Enter button on keyboard user can toss the die. After the computer welcomes user an Introduction slide is displayed where user can select to play a game, read game instructions or exit through the game.

## 3. Purpose:

The aim of this project is to develop a graphics package which supports basic operations which include building a 2D GAME. The package must also has a user-friendly interface. The objective of developing this model was to design and apply the skills we learnt in class.

## 4. Algorithm:

Initailly cover(displays “Snakes And Ladders”),load and menu(New game,Instructions,Quit) functions are called. If we start a game the board functions draws an outline,snake images using snake function, ladder image using ladder function on window screen on which two coins are positioned using position function and users starts playing. Using checkposition function coin movements are tracked with presence of snakes and ladders on board. Move function is used to move coins according to numbers obtained on dice.
